## Project Overview

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. In this project, we have focused on building a user-friendly GUI application that allows users to input tweets and analyze their sentiment using custom-built machine learning algorithms.

### Key Learning Objectives

- Developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter.
- Implementing sentiment analysis from scratch without relying on pre-built NLP libraries.
- Gaining hands-on experience with machine learning algorithms for text classification.
- Enhancing Python programming skills.
- Collaborating on a group project in a university setting.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the project, make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed. If you are using a virtual environment, activate it first.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the Twitter Sentiment Analysis GUI application:

   ```bash
   python xsa.py
   ```
## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: The application provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with.

- **Custom Sentiment Analysis**: Unlike using pre-built libraries, this project implements sentiment analysis algorithms from scratch, allowing for deeper learning and customization.

- **Text Preprocessing**: The project includes text preprocessing steps like tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming.
